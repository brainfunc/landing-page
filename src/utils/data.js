    your brain. There are 12 types of neurons (corresponding to 12 brain sub parts),

    Cerebellum and the Brain Stem. Each major part is constructed using 4 sub parts.
    Once you have all sub parts for any major part (with any strength), you will
    be able to construct it. You need atleast one major part to partake in Balance
    Battles.`

    description: `Balance battles are different than Power Battles. Here not only
    does sub part strength play a role, but also their combination. Getting the
    right combination of sub part strength to construct a powerful major part can
    be tricky. This is currently only possible via experimentation by fighting
    in battles.`

    possible if you have the complete brain - viz all 3 major parts. The bounties
    for Ultimate Battles are higher and these can be considered a more advanced
    version of Balance Battles.`
